                                PHREEQC

       A program for speciation, batch-reaction, one-dimensional 
            transport, and inverse geochemical calculations

This file describes three batch versions of PHREEQC for Windows and Linux: (1) A
Windows version with a compiled executable, (2) A Windows version that has source
code that can be compiled with Visual Studio solutions that are generated by CMake,
and (3) A Linux version with source code that can be compiled by a Makefile generated
by configure. For Linux, there is no version with an executable, and compilation is
required.

No graphical user interface exists for Linux. (For Windows, a graphical user
interface, PhreeqcI, is available at
http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/index.html and a
Notepad++ interface is available at http://www.hydrochemistry.eu/downl.html.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
C. Installing the Windows batch version of PHREEQC with executable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: the person installing the software generally must have administrator 
rights. 

To install the batch version, double-click phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.msi to
execute the installation program and follow the directions on the screen. The batch
version is completely independent from the GUI version.

Default installation is in the directory:
C:\Program Files\USGS\phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@-x64

which includes subdirectories:
   bin\
   database\
   doc\
   examples\
   src\
   test\

The installation sets environmental variables PATH, PATH_PHREEQC, and PHREEQC_ROOT.
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
D. Compiling and installing the Windows batch version of PHREEQC without executable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, to compile the IPhreeqc library, you will need:

   (a) CMake (build process manager)
   (b) a C++ compiler,
   (c) familiarity with the compiler and the Windows operating system.
  
   
D.1. Download and install CMake

   CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/. If you download the
   executable, CMake is installed when you execute it.
	
D.2. Unzip the distribution file phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.zip
  
   The directory phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@ is created when the files are
   extracted; if this directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it
   before extracting the files.

   The following directory structure is created (the contents of each directory are
   shown to the right):

   phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@      Files related to CMake
     `--database    Database files required during execution
     `--doc         Documentation files 
     `--examples    Examples from user's guide--used in verification tests
     `--src         Source code
     `--test        Files used to test the compilation 
 
D.3.  Generate a Visual Studio solution
 
   CMake has many options other than Visual Studio, but here we assume that you are
   using some version of Visual Studio. On the first use of CMake, it may be
   necessary to close all Visual Studio instances.
 	
   Open CMake. 
   
      Fill in the top two lines:
         Where is the source code: 
            The top level directory (ie c:/phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@).
         Where to build the binaries: 
            A new directory. It is suggested that the name of the directory include
	    the characteristics of the library that is built, including the VS
	    version, and 32/64 bit, such as VS2012_x64.
 	
   Click Configure. 
      From the pulldown menu of the cmake-gui popup, select the 64-bit version 
      for your Visual Studio. Normally, the default radio button should be 
      sufficient. Click Finish.
 	
   Options in the top panel:
      (1) CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX--Sets the the install directory where the 
             library and header files will be saved. It is suggested that
 	     an INSTALL directory be defined inside the directory chosen 
 	     for the binaries.
 	
   Click Configure until the screen is not red. If the screen remains red, you will
   have to deal with the CMake error messages.
 	
   Click Generate.
 	
   You should now have a Visual Studio solution file (.sln) in the directory chosen
   for the binaries (second line of CMake screen). At any point, you can delete the
   contents of the directory and start over. You can make solutions for different
   Visual Studios, or different options in other directories.
 	
D.4. Compile and install PHREEQC
 
   Open the Visual Studio solution in the build directory defined in CMake.
 	
   The default configuration is "Debug". If you want a release libraries
   (or dlls) and examples,	change the configuration to "Release".
 
   Build ALL_BUILD. 
      IPhreeqc is compiled.
 
   Build RUN_TESTS. Programs that test IPhreeqc are compiled and run, and optionally
   (CMake IPHREEQC_FORTRAN_TESTING option) the Fortran test project.
 	
   Build INSTALL. 
      The executables, PHREEQC database files, and documentation are installed in the
      install directory selected in CMake (denoted "install" in the following
      descriptions).
      
   Install:
      RELEASE.txt                           Release notes
      README.txt                            this readme file

   registered either by installing the Phreeqc batch version with executable or the
   PhreeqcI MSI, or through the use of the Visual Studio Tool gacutil.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
E. Compiling and installing the Linux batch version of PHREEQC 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No support beyond this README file is provided for users compiling their own
versions of the software. In general, to compile the software, you will need:

       (a) a C++ compiler, and
       (b) a minimal level of knowledge of configure, Make, the compiler, and
           the Linux operating system.

A Makefile can be generated by configure, and the Makefile can be used to
compile, test, and install the software.

E.1. Extracting the files

   Follow the steps below to extract the files from a distribution tar file.

   Steps in extracting files                  Explanation
   ----------------------------------------   -----------------------------------
   gunzip phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar.gz           Uncompress the tar.gz file.
 
   tar -xvpof phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar          Extract files from the tar file.

   The directory phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@ is created when the files are
   extracted; if this directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it
   before extracting the files.

   The following directory structure is created (the contents of each directory are
   shown to the right):

   phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@      Files related to configure
     `--config      More configure files
     `--database    Database files required during execution
     `--doc         Documentation files 
     `--examples    Examples from user's guide--used in verification tests
     `--src         Source code
     `--test        Files used to test the compilation

Notes:  (a) A compiled executable is not included in the source distribution.
            
        (b) It is recommended that no user files be kept in the PHREEQC directory
	    structure.

E.2.  Change directory to the directory that was extracted from the tar file.

      cd phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@
        
E.3.  Make a directory, for example, Release.
    
      mkdir Release
    
E.4.  Change directory to Release.
    
      cd Release

E.5.  Run configure
    
   Many of the options for configure can be seen by typing:
    
      ../configure --help
        
   The most common option: --prefix=dir specifies the directory for installation of
      the library. Default is /usr/local, $HOME would install to your home directory.
            
   Run configure as follows:    
    
      ../configure [options] 

E.6.  Compile the program
    
    make [-j n]

    Optionally, use -j n--where n is the number of compilations make runs in parallel.
    
E.7.  Check that compiled version runs the test cases. 
   Check may take several minutes.
    
      make check
    
   Results of running the test cases are stored in the directory Release/test

E.8. Install the program. 

   By default the program is installed in /usr/local/bin and
   /usr/local/share/doc/phreeqc. You can specify an installation prefix other than
   "/usr/local" by using the prefix option, prefix=$HOME for example.
    
      make install
        
   The locations of various files are given below, where "install" is the
   installation directory, /usr/local by default, or the value given by the --prefix
   option to configure.

F. Running PHREEQC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If PHREEQC has been installed in a directory included in the users' PATH, the
program can be executed from a command line with any of the commands below.

  command to execute PHREEQC     explanation
  -----------------------------  -----------------------------------------
  phreeqc                        The program will query for each of the
                                 needed files.

  phreeqc input                  The input file is named input, the output
                                 file will be named input.out and the
                                 default database file will be used.
  
  phreeqc input output           The input file is named input, the output
                                 file is named output, and the default
                                 database file will be used.
  
  phreeqc input output database  All file names are specified explicitly.
  
  phreeqc input output database screen_output     

                                 All file names are specified explicitly,
                                 and screen output is directed to the
                                 file screen_output.

If phreeqc is not located in a directory in PATH, the executable may be copied to the
current directory. In addition the default database file, phreeqc.dat, or another
desired database may need to be in the current directory.

PHREEQC is run by a script on Linux and a batch file on Windows. The environmental 
variable PHREEQC_DATABASE can be used to specify a default database.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
G. Description of test cases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tests are described in the table below, where 'test' corresponds
to the example number in the PHREEQC manual.
