	PHAST, Version @VERSION@, @VER_DATE@

PHAST is a 3-dimensional, reactive-transport simulator that is
available for Windows and Linux. PHAST simulates constant-density
saturated flow, multicomponent transport, and a wide range of
equilibrium and kinetic chemical reactions.



INSTALLATION


Windows Installation:
---------------------

The Windows version uses InstallShield to install the programs PHAST,
PHASTHDF, and Model Viewer. You need administrator privileges to
execute the installation file phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.exe.

The installation directory is \Program Files\USGS\phast-@VERSION@, which
contains the following subdirectories:
	\bin
	\database
	\doc
	\examples
	\lib
	\Model Viewer
	\src

Linux Installation with tar:
----------------------------

Extract the files from phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@-Linux.tar.gz with the command:

tar -xzf phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@-Linux.tar.gz

Files will be extracted into a directory named phast-@VERSION@. The 
following subdirectories will be created within phast-@VERSION@:
	/bin
	/database
	/doc
	/examples
	/lib
	/src


Linux Installation with RPM:
----------------------------

The programs PHAST and PHASTHDF can be installed with the RedHat
Package Manager (rpm) on Linux operating systems.  (Model Viewer is
only available in the Windows version).  You must have root authority
to install with rpm. The --prefix option may be used to change the
installation directory. The programs are installed with the following
command, where square brackets indicate an optional field:

rpm -i [--prefix=dirname] phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.i586.rpm

The installation directory for the source, documentation, and examples
is /usr/share/doc/phast-@VERSION@, where the directory /usr may be changed
with the --prefix option. The subdirectories of this directory are

	/database
	/doc
	/examples
	/src

The installation directory for the scripts and executables is
/usr/bin, where the directory /usr may be changed with the --prefix
option.

Additional files required to run phasthdf are installed into the
/usr/lib directory, where the directory /usr may also be changed
using the --prefix option.

PHAST can be uninstalled with the following command:

rpm -e phast



DOCUMENTATION

The doc subdirectory of each installation contains phast.pdf,
phreeqc.pdf, and wrir02-4172.pdf, which document all of the keyword
data blocks for PHAST. The ModelViewer\doc subdirectory in the Windows
version includes the documentation for ModelViewer, ofr02-106.pdf.



RUNNING PHAST (Serial or single-processor version)

For reactive-transport simulations, PHAST needs three data files for
execution, (1) the flow and transport data file,(2) the chemistry data
file, and (3) the thermodynamic database file. For flow-only
calculations, only the flow and transport data file is needed. Running
PHAST is a two-step process that is automated in scripts (Unix,
bin/phast; Windows, bin\phast.bat). A prefix, from which input and
output file names are derived, is defined as an argument to the
script. Within the script,the program PHASTINPUT (bin/phastinput) is
run to generate an intermediate input file named Phast.tmp. Following
successful completion of the PHASTINPUT program, the script invokes
the program PHAST (bin/phast-ser), which performs the
reactive-transport simulations. The script (Unix or Windows) is
invoked from a command-line window as follows:

phast prefix [database] 

The flow and transport data file must be named prefix.trans.dat; the
chemistry data file must be named prefix.chem.dat. Optionally,
[database] is the name of the thermodynamic database file; if this
argument is not defined, the database file must be named phast.dat.



PARALLEL (MULTIPROCESSOR) VERSIONS OF PHAST

A parallel version for PHAST for Windows has been compiled with the
MPICH version of MPI (bin\phast-mpich). For Linux, the parallel
version has been compiled with the LAM version of MPI
(bin/phast-lam). The parallel versions use exactly the same input
files as the serial versions. Limited help with installation and
running the parallel versions is given in Appendix C of the PHAST
documentation (doc/phast.pdf).



PHASTHDF

PHASTHDF (bin/phasthdf) is a Java program that allows you to extract
data from the HDF output file (prefix.h5). The Java 2 Runtime
Environment must be installed on your computer to be able to run
PHASTHDF. 



MODEL VIEWER

Model Viewer (Model Viewer\bin\modview.exe) is a graphical user
interface that allows visualization of data stored in the HDF output
file (prefix.h5).



SOURCE-CODE FILES

Executables are provided in the PHAST distribution, so it is not
usually necessary to recompile the PHAST suite of programs. If you
want to modify the programs or compile for a different operating
system, source-code files for PHASTINPUT, PHAST, and PHASTHDF are
included in subdirectories of the directory /src. Makefiles for
PHASTINPUT and PHAST are included as templates; however, these
Makefiles will require modification to work on your computer.



INPUT FILES

The flow and transport data file, chemistry data file, and database
file are all composed of keyword data blocks. The keyword data blocks
for chemistry are identical to PHREEQC, and any PHREEQC calculation
can be performed.  PHREEQC is run first when PHAST starts to define
solutions, equilibrium-phase assemblages, exchange assemblages,
surface assemblages, solid-solution assemblages, gas phases, and sets
of kinetic reactions with associated identifying numbers.  The
numbered entities are used to set initial conditions in the model
domain and to define boundary solutions.

The database file phast.dat is the same as phreeqc.dat distributed
with PHREEQC. It contains the definitions of elements, aqueous
species, mineral phase, exchange species, and surface species.

The keywords for the flow and transport data file have been devised
for PHAST, but are based on input for the model HST3D (stripping out
anything related to heat or density and using head in place of
pressure). Most of the data blocks are related to the flow and
transport parameters needed to simulate ground-water flow and solute
transport.

The main interaction between the flow and transport data file and the
chemistry data file occurs in CHEMISTRY_IC (of the flow and transport
data file), where entity numbers (solutions, equilibrium-phase
assemblages, etc, as defined in the chemistry data file) are assigned
to spatial zones (rectangular parallelepipeds) to establish the
initial conditions and reactions in the model domain. Note that it is
possible to define initial conditions that change linearly in one of
the coordinate directions for each zone (for example solution
composition could vary linearly between two end members along the x
coordinate direction for a zone).

LEAKY_BC, FLUX_BC, SPECIFIED_BC, RIVER, and WELL all specify flow
conditions that may result in a flux of water into the domain. In that
case, the solution composition associated with that flux must be
defined, again with index numbers referring to solutions defined in
the chemistry data file. In the _BC boundary conditions, it is
possible to define a fixed or linear distribution of solution
composition.



EXAMPLES

Example problems are included in the examples directory of the
installation.  Four of the examples are documented in the phast.pdf
file. They include a pulse of a linearly decaying and sorbing
component (ex1); chain decay resulting in production of three
degradation products (ex2); microbial consumption of a substrate with
microbial growth (ex3); and a field-scale model of for Central
Oklahoma that uses most of the features of PHAST (ex4).  Another
example is an ion exchange problem equivalent to example 11 in the
PHREEQC manual. The other examples are test problems used to debug
PHAST that often use only one feature of PHAST. Some of the examples
contain no chemistry and are simply a test of the flow model.
