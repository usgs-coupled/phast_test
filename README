	PHAST, Version @VERSION@, @VER_DATE@

PHAST is a 3-dimensional, reactive-transport simulator that is available for Windows and Linux.
PHAST simulates constant-density saturated flow, multicomponent transport, and a wide range of
equilibrium and kinetic chemical reactions. PHAST version 3 uses PhreeqcRM as the reaction
module; however, all input and output is unchanged from PHAST version 2.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
E. Compiling and installing the batch version for Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No support beyond this README file is provided for users compiling their own
versions of the software. In general, to compile the software, you will need:
   make
   C++ compiler
   Fortran 90 compiler
   hdf5 libraries >= 1.6.5
   boost C++ libraries >= 1.33
   zlib libraries >= 1.2.2

Additionally for the MPI version:
   mpi c++ wrapper: (ie mpic++ mpicxx mpiCC)
   mpi F90 wrapper: (ie mpif90)
	
A Makefile for your system can be generated by configure, and the Makefile can be used to
compile, test, and install the software.

E.1. Extracting the files

Follow the steps below to extract the files from a distribution tar file.

   Steps in extracting files                  Explanation
   ----------------------------------------   -----------------------------------
   gunzip phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar.gz     Uncompress the tar.gz file.
 
   tar -xvpof phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar    Extract files from the tar file.

   The directory phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@ is created when the files are
   extracted; if this directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it
   before extracting the files.

   The following directory structure is created (the contents of each directory are
   shown to the right):

   phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@   
      aclocal.m4                 Configure file
      CMakeLists.txt             CMake file
      configure                  Configure executable
      configure.ac               Configure file
      INSTALL                    Brief description of configure
      Makefile.am                Configure file

      /examples                  Examples from user's guide--used in verification tests
      /m4                        Configure files
      /src                       Source code
      /test                      Files used to test the compilation

Notes: (a) A compiled executable is not included in the Linux distribution.
            
       (b) It is recommended that no user files be kept in the installation directory
           structure.

E.2.  Change directory to the directory that was extracted from the tar file.

   cd phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@

E.3.  Make a directory, for example, Release.
    
   mkdir Release

E.4.  Change directory to Release.
    
   cd Release

E.5.  Run configure
    
   Many of the options for configure can be seen by typing:
    
      ../configure --help
        
   Most common options:
      --prefix=dir--specifies the directory for installation of the
    		library. Default is /usr/local, $HOME would install
    		to your home directory.
      --with-mpi=yes--specifies that MPI (Message Passing Interface)
    		will be used for parallelization of PhreeqcRM. Make sure
                the MPI binary directory (the directory that contains 
                mpicc, for example) is included in your PATH environmental 
                variable. Default is no, in which case, OpenMP is used 
                for parallelization.
      --disable-openmp--specifies that OpenMP is not used. This option 
    	 	is used if you want neither kind of parallelization.
           
   Run configure as follows:    
    
      ../configure [options] 
      
E.6.  Compile the program
    
   make [-j n]

   Optionally, use -j n--where n is the number of compilations make runs in parallel.
    
E.7.  Check that compiled version runs the test cases. 
   Check may take several minutes.
    
      make check
    
   Logs for running the test cases are stored in the directory Release/test. Results
   of run are in Release/examples/phrqex11.

E.8. Install the program. 

   By default the program is installed in /usr/local/bin and 
   /usr/local/share/doc/phast-@VERSION@-@REVISION@. You can specify an installation
   prefix other than "/usr/local" by using the prefix option of configure, 
   prefix=$HOME for example.
    
      make install
        
   The locations of various files are given below, where "install" is the installation directory,
   /usr/local by default, or the value given by the --prefix option to configure. "install"
   represents the install directory in the following list.
   

   Executables:
      install/bin/phast                    Batch file for running phastinput and phast. The
                                           version of phast (MPI or OpenMP) will depend
                                           on the last "make install".
      install/bin/phastinput               phastinput executable. phastinput converts
                                           the *.trans.dat file to Phast.tmp, which
                                           is read by phast.
      install/bin/phasthdf                 Java utility to extract information from an 
                                           HDF (.h5) file.
      install/bin/phast-openmp             Executable for OpenMP version of phast.
      install/bin/phast-mpi                Executable for MPI version of phast.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
F. Running the batch versions of PHAST 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

For reactive-transport simulations, PHAST needs at least three data files for execution, (1) the 
flow and transport data file, (2) the chemistry data file, and (3) the thermodynamic database file. 
For flow-only calculations, only the flow and transport data file is needed. Running PHAST is a 
two-step process that is automated in scripts (Unix, install/bin/phast; Windows, bin\phast.bat). 
For windows, the path to the script is installed, and you should be able to run without a 
complete path. Similarly, if the install directory is in your path, you do not need complete
path names. A prefix, from which input and output file names are derived, is defined as an 
argument to the script. Within the script, the program phastinput (Unix, install/bin/phastinput; 
Windows bin\phastinput.exe) is run to generate an intermediate input file named Phast.tmp. Following 
successful completion of the phastinput program, the script invokes the program phast, which 
performs the reactive-transport simulations. For Unix, the script will run the version of phast 
that was last installed (make install), either MPI or OpenMP.

For Linux, the script is invoked as follows:

   phast prefix [-n PROCESSES] [-db DATABASE]

The flow and transport data file must be named prefix.trans.dat; the chemistry data file must be
named prefix.chem.dat. Optionally, for OpenMP, PROCESSES is the number of processes or threads 
to use for the calculations. Optionally, DATABASE is the name of the thermodynamic database file; 
if this argument is not defined, the database file is assumed to be named phast.dat.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
G. Running PHASTHDF to extract data from the HDF file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

PHASTHDF (Linux, install/bin/phasthdf; Windows bin\phasthdf) is a Java program that allows 
you to extract data from the HDF output file (prefix.h5). Simply execute the program and 
define the HDF file and the data to extract from the screens provided.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
H. Running MODEL VIEWER to visualize results on Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Model Viewer (\Model Viewer\bin\modview.exe) is a graphical user interface that allows
visualization of data stored in the HDF output file (prefix.h5).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I. Input files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The flow and transport data file, chemistry data file, and database file are all composed of
keyword data blocks. The keyword data blocks for chemistry are identical to PHREEQC, and any
PHREEQC calculation can be performed. PHREEQC is run first when PHAST starts to define
solutions, equilibrium-phase assemblages, exchange assemblages, surface assemblages, solid-
solution assemblages, gas phases, and sets of kinetic reactions with associated identifying
numbers. The numbered entities are used to set initial conditions in the model domain and to
define boundary solutions.

The database file phast.dat is the same as phreeqc.dat distributed with PHREEQC. It contains the
definitions of elements, aqueous species, mineral phase, exchange species, and surface species.

The keywords for the flow and transport data file have been devised for PHAST, but are based on
input for the model HST3D (stripping out anything related to heat or density and using head in
place of pressure). Most of the data blocks are related to the flow and transport parameters
needed to simulate ground-water flow and solute transport.

The main interaction between the flow and transport data file and the chemistry data file occurs
in CHEMISTRY_IC (of the flow and transport data file), where entity numbers (solutions,
equilibrium-phase assemblages, etc, as defined in the chemistry data file) are assigned to
spatial zones (rectangular parallelepipeds) to establish the initial conditions and reactions in
the model domain. Note that it is possible to define initial conditions that change linearly in
one of the coordinate directions for each zone (for example solution composition could vary
linearly between two end members along the x coordinate direction for a zone).

LEAKY_BC, FLUX_BC, SPECIFIED_BC, RIVER, and WELL all specify flow conditions that may result in a
flux of water into the domain. In that case, the solution composition associated with that flux
must be defined, again with index numbers referring to solutions defined in the chemistry data
file. In the _BC boundary conditions, it is possible to define a fixed or linear distribution of
solution composition.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
J. Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Example problems are included in the examples directory of the installation.  Six of the examples
are documented in the phast2-TM6-A35.pdf file. They include a pulse of a linearly decaying and sorbing
component (ex1); chain decay resulting in production of three degradation products (ex2);
microbial consumption of a substrate with microbial growth (ex3); and a field-scale model for
Central Oklahoma that uses most of the features of PHAST (ex4). A simulation of a sewage effluent
plume at Cape Cod, Massachusetts (ex5), and another simulation of the sewage plume on a refined
grid (ex6).

Several other examples are included in the example directory, including an ion exchange problem
equivalent to example 11 in the PHREEQC manual (phrqex11). The other examples are test problems
used to debug PHAST that often use only one feature of PHAST. Some of the examples contain no
chemistry and are simply a test of the flow model.
